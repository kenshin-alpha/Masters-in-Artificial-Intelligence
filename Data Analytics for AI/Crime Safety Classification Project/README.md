# Crime Safety Classification Project

This project classifies public spaces by safety level using crime data from `RCD06.20251204131643.csv`.

## Project Structure
- `data/` : Contains the raw dataset
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and analysis
- `src/` : Python scripts for data processing and modeling
- `reports/` : Final report and visualizations

## Steps
1. Data Understanding & Retrieval
2. Data Preprocessing & EDA
3. Feature Engineering
4. Label Creation
5. Model Preparation
6. Model Selection & Training
7. Model Evaluation
8. Feature Selection
9. Visualization & Insights
10. Reporting

## Dataset Source
- Crime Rate Detection: `RCD06.20251204131643.csv`
